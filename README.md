# SEAL Club Inhouse Rules

## Procedural Rules:

* If you join a queue, you must accept the game, select players for your team (if selected as captain), and join the appropriate lobby.
* Games are played in Captains Draft or Captains Mode - abuse of the CD random hero bug is not permitted.
* All players are required to be present in Discord with the rest of their team.
* In the case of technical issues or disconnects, pause the game immediately and inform the opposing team of the situation - the game may not be unpaused until resolution of the issue or 10 minutes pass, whichever occurs first.
* Abuse of the rules must be reported to an inhouse admin in PM. Failure to follow these procedural rules WILL result in some form of punishment.

## Behavioral Rules

* While being present in Discord with the team is a requirement, voice communication is not.
* Some amount of casual flame is inevitable in inhouses, particularly with this crowd. As such, rulings by admins as to what constitutes overly toxic behavior is not set in stone. Some things to keep in mind:
  * Player skill in these inhouses range from high 6k to triple digit MMRs. Flaming a 3k player for being 3k is not productive and not acceptable.
  * No hate speech (speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender).
  * No cyber-bullying.
  * Once a game is over, itâ€™s over. Do not take arguments and flame wars into the SEAL Discord.
* BM pauses are acceptable - this rule may be adjusted in the future if complaints start building up, so keep it to a minimum.
* Action is more likely to be taken against you after repeated complaints of poor behavior are reported by multiple individuals.
* Punishment depends on the severity of the infraction and previous behavioral incidents.

## Punishments

* Depending on the situation, possible punishments may include a warning, a queue ban lasting between 1 hour and 1 season, or a permanent unvouch from both the inhouse and general SEAL leagues.
